###Compiling/Running instructions

###Other issues
  + As far as I know, everything in this project works. I've tried all of the scenarios listed in the rubric as well as trying to overload it with many waiters/customers, but it has handled them all.
  + One note: The food that a customer chooses is based on the first letter of their name. If all the customers have names starting with the same letter, they will all order the same food.
  + If you encounter any other problems, feel free to email me!
